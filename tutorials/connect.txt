To connect you should've setup an ngrok tcp tunnel, if not subsitute it with the Raspberry Pi's IPv4 Address

# Enter ssh
    # ngrok tunnel
    ! You can find the tcp forwarded by going to the domain you set up in the setup.txt tutorial + /ngrok
        You'll find a json thing, go to tunnels -> and find one who's public_url starts with "tcp://"

    ex. Forwarding TCP tcp://4.tcp.ngrok.io:10561 -> 127.0.0.1:22
    PORT = 10561
    IP = 4.tcp.ngrok.io
    admin = whatever your hostname was when you flashed the Raspberry Pi
    `ssh -p PORT admin@IP`
    It'll then ask for a password, which you set when flashing the Raspberry Pi

    # ip tunnel
    IP = ip of your Raspberry Pi (IPv4)
    admin = whatever your hostname was when you flashed the Raspberry Pi
    `ssh admin@IP`
    It'll then ask for a password, which you set when flashing the Raspberry Pi

Boom! Now you should be connected
